## 😫 The Problem

The traditional campus hiring process is inefficient and outdated:

- ⏱️ **Time-Consuming:** Interviewing 500+ students can take weeks.
- 🎯 **Subjectivity:** Human evaluation varies widely.
- ❌ **Lack of Feedback:** Students often get no insights post-interview.
- 📉 **No Data:** Institutions miss critical improvement metrics.

**Result?** Talented students go unnoticed, companies lose time and resources, and placement records fall short.
